# DirectX11-Graphics-API

API for 3D rendering using DX11 in C++ and HLSL. Developed in weekly sprints over a 3 month period.

Notable features
- organized around GraphicsObjects for each shader used
- supports arbitrary number of point and spot light sources
- shaders support gradient distance fog
- includes premade models, including basic 3d shapes (cube, sphere, etc), skybox, and terrain models automatically generated from a texture

Example scene rendered using API:
